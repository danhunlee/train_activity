# train_activity
In this homework, I built a system using firebase to keep track of the train schedules. Also, I made a card body using bootstrap to add new trains. 
Using bootstrap, I designed the layouts of the website and using an image from upsplash, I made the background. 
You can add train name, destination, first train time, and frequency of the specific train. 
Firebase keep the records of the datas so when you refresh the browser, the datas don't go away.
